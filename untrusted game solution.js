 *              you can see it is so dumb. It has basically the following behavior.
 *              <p>if player is above drone and the difference in Y axis is greater than difference in x axis,
 *              it will move up, otherwise if player is below the drone and the difference in y axis(upDist, which is negative) is

 *              <p>But it doesn't have any check before it moves, so it doesn't check if it can move up and
 *              will try to move up and up even though it has a wall above, therefore it cannot move.
 *              <p>So if we make some kind of walls that the drone can be trapped under, and make drone try to
 *              move up even though it can't, then we can get past the drone easily. With my solution if
 *              you just keep moving right, upDist will become greater than left Dist so

/**
 * 17 Pointers: This level has lots of traps and teleporters. And the teleporters randomly connects to
 * another teleporter or trap. The comments at editable area gives hint that we could use 'map.getCanvasCoords()...'
 * So I used the function to draw lines from a teleporter to another teleporter.
 * But the drawing was not so clear enough to see what is connected to what, so I put more safety by
 * setting teleporters target to null when the target is type of 'trap'.
 * With some repetition I was able to go to exit but not always because, in this random generation of the map,
 * some times there was no way to exit at all.
 * <p> So I made second solution that all teleporters to connects player to near by empty cell of exit.
